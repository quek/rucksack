- Write test cases for schema updates and user defined methods for
  UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS.

- Indexing: compare the specified slot/class indexes to the indexes that
  exist in the Rucksack, *not* to the indexes specified in the previous
  version of the class definition.  Otherwise we get inconsistencies
  when we recompile class definitions from scratch with a Rucksack that
  already exists.

- Write test case for slots with redefined indexes.  This also tests
  the default method for UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS.

- FINALIZE-INHERITANCE: Compute slot diffs for obsolete schemas.

- More work on UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS.

- Partial implementation of UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS
  & friends.

* 2006-08-29

- Example-1: indexing should still work after recompiling.

- RUCKSACK-UPDATE-SLOT-INDEXES: Remove indexes for old slots that
  don't exist anymore.

- Some work on schema updates.

- Compute persistent slots at the right moment.

- Make sure that indexing works correctly with subclasses.
- Fix some more indexing bugs.

- The class and slot indexes were normal hash tables, but they should be
  persistent objects like everything else: I replaced them by btrees.

- Get process-lock and process-unlock working on SBCL (thanks to Geoff Cant).

- Save and load the index tables when closing/opening a rucksack.

- Implement the :UNIQUE slot option.

- Improve predefined slot index specs.

- Add a SERIAL-TRANSACTION-RUCKSACK class that allows for only one transaction
  at a time (by using a transaction lock).  This allows for a fast track
  towards a working Rucksack implementation.  Then parallel transactions
  can be added later.

- Don't do any GC at all while a transaction is writing objects to disk.
  Instead we keep track of the amount of disk space allocated by the committing
  transaction.  Then we do a (partial) GC immediately after committing the
  transaction.
